# -Dynamic-Word-Search-A-2D-Word-Guess-Game

Developed an interactive Word Guess Game in C++ using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles. This project challenges players to locate hidden words within a dynamically generated 2D grid. It combines advanced OOP concepts, robust algorithms, and efficient memory management to deliver a seamless and engaging user experience.

Features:

Difficulty Modes: Two modes (Easy and Hard) with three progressively challenging levels in each.
Dynamic Grids: Implemented grids of varying sizes (10x10, 15x15, 20x20) using dynamic memory allocation.
Modular Design: Leveraged OOP concepts like inheritance, polymorphism, friend classes, and static members for scalable, reusable code.
Interactive Gameplay: Designed a user-friendly menu for game initiation, instructions, score viewing, and exiting.
Persistent Scoring: Maintained top scores using file storage, ensuring long-term data tracking.
Word Validation: Ensured accurate and dynamic word recognition in rows, columns, and diagonals.
This project highlights proficiency in C++, algorithm design, dynamic memory allocation, and user-centric application development. It reflects a commitment to creating engaging software solutions with optimized performance.
